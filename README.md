# Didomi Headless Widgets Demo

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository provides a code example demonstrating how to implement Didomi’s headless widgets. Due to the use of our private UI Library, you won’t be able to run the app locally. To see the app in action, please visit [Didomi’s live example](https://didomi.github.io/headless-widget-react/). To integrate, you’ll need to connect our headless methods and components with your own UI elements.
